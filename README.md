DESCRIPTION:    A Star Pathfinding Visualizer
DEPENDENCIES:   Python 3.XX, PyGame 2.6.1

INFO:           This program simulates the A Star algorithm to pathfind in a randomly generated grid of cells that can either be open, blocked, or start/end cells.
                The algorithm is visualized in real time showing the current path, the open set, and the closed set.
                Press the return key to regenerate the map and restart the algorithm.
